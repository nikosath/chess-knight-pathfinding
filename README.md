## chess-knight-pathfinding

My Java implementation of the AStar pathfinding algorithm for finding the shortest path for a chess-piece such as the knight (or king etc.), given a starting position and an ending position, with a constraint of maximum allowed moves e.g. 3 moves. 
Some inputs might not have a solution, in this case the program returns null. A few unit tests included.
